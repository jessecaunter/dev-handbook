# Color Contrast Accessibility Testing

## Checking WCAG Contrast Ratios in DevTools

### Problem

Insufficient color contrast between text and background makes content difficult to read, especially for users with visual impairments. Many websites fail WCAG accessibility guidelines due to poor contrast choices.

### Solution

Use browser DevTools color picker to check contrast ratios during development and ensure WCAG compliance before deployment.

### Implementation

#### In Firefox DevTools:

1. Inspect an element with colored text
2. In the CSS Rules panel, click on the color swatch (small colored circle) next to the color value
3. The color picker opens showing:
   - Current contrast ratio (e.g., 7.28)
   - WCAG compliance level indicators (AA, AAA)

#### When to Check:

Check contrast ratios when choosing colors, updating designs, or during accessibility audits.

### Benefits

- Catch accessibility issues early in development
- Ensure WCAG compliance without external tools
- Real-time feedback while adjusting colors
- Improve readability for all users

### Browser Support

- **Chrome and Edge DevTools:** Contrast ratio display with expandable details
  - Shows AA and AAA compliance status
  - Suggests alternative colors when requirements aren't met
