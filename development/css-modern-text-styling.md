# Modern CSS Text Styling

## Enhanced Text Decoration Control

### Problem

Traditional `text-decoration: underline` provides limited control over underline appearance.

### Solution

Use modern text decoration properties for fine-grained control.

### Implementation

```css
h1 {
  text-decoration: underline red;
  text-decoration-thickness: 3px;
  text-underline-offset: 6px; /* Distance from text */
  text-decoration-skip-ink: auto; /* Skips underline where it would cross over glyphs */
}
```

### Benefits

- Better typography control
- Improved readability
- Professional-looking underlines
- Respects descenders (g, y, p, q)

### Browser Support

- Firefox, Chrome, Edge
- Haven't tested in other browsers
